This project is a modern e-commerce web application built using React, React Router, Bootstrap, and Context API. It demonstrates how to design a functional shopping platform with dynamic product listings, category filters, and detailed product views.

The application uses a custom API hook (useCustomApi) to fetch data from a local JSON server (http://localhost:3000/products), making it easy to switch between categories and fetch product details dynamically. This architecture ensures scalability and reusability across components.
